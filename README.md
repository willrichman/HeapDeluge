A [Stack Overflow](stackoverflow.com) client created for [Code Fellows'](http://codefellows.org) iOS Development Accelerator Week 6.

##Monday:

- Setup your model layer of your stack overflow client. Create a class for a question and a user. Model them using the stack overflow API.
- Structurally, set your app up very similar to our Github client. Use a split view controller to help with universal layout. 
- Create a network controller with a method designed to fetch questions based on a tag. Consult the stack overflow API documentation to find the endpoint for this.
- Parse the results and show them in a table view. Do this inside of a QuestionSearchViewController.

##Tuesday:

- Get OAuth working with your app.
